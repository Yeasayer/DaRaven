Once upon a midnight %s, while I pondered, %s and %s,
Over many a quaint and curious %s of forgotten %s,
While I %s, nearly napping, suddenly there came a %s,
As of %s gently rapping, rapping at my %s door.
'’Tis some %s,' I muttered, 'tapping at my %s door—
Only this and nothing more.'

Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the %s December;
And each separate %s ember wrought its %s upon the floor.
Eagerly I %s the morrow;%s I had sought to borrow
From my %s surcease of sorrow—sorrow for the %s Lenore—
For the %s and %s maiden whom the angels name %s—
Nameless here for evermore.
