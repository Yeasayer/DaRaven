Once upon a midnight adj, while I pondered, adj and adj,
Over many a quaint and curious noun of forgotten noun,
While I ved, nearly napping, suddenly there came a noun,
As of noun gently rapping, rapping at my loc door.
'’Tis some noun,' I muttered, 'tapping at my loc door—
Only this and nothing more.'

Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the adj December;
And each separate ving ember wrought its noun upon the floor.
Eagerly I ved the morrow; adv I had sought to borrow
From my pnoun surcease of sorrow—sorrow for the adj girl—
For the adj and adj maiden whom the angels name girl—
Nameless here for evermore.
